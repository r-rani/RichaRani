                    <p>As an engineer, I have one primary objective: To facilitate positive social impact with innovative creative solutions to pertinent problems.</p>
                    <p>I am an electrical engineering student at McMaster currently enrolled in my third year of a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Management at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I aspire to explore all electrical engineering applications and strive to work as a hardware or firmware engineer. </p>
                    <p>I value working with other like-minded engineers in collaborative workspaces. I am a curious, goal-oriented, engineer who thrives off of new challenges and loves learning new topics. </p>
                    <p>Alongside my education in engineering, I enjoy exploring engineering in real-world contexts. I have previous experience working as a system controller during my co-op. I  am also currently working with teams to build a solar power car and a rocket. In addition, I am constantly working on side projects to explore a wide range of aspects of electrical engineering</p>
                    <p>I am interested in working with technologies such as embedded systems, aerospace, avionics, control systems, vehicle development, artificial intelligence, chip design, and more. </p>
                    <p>I am excited to see what the future of technology holds and I aspire to make an impact in the landscape of engineering.</p>

                <b>Software</b>
                <p>I enjoy learning new softwares for different applications. I enjoy using <b>Python</b> for applications such as analyzing data, creating backends, and new applications. I used it in my hackathon projects Change My Tune and in a sudoku solver which used a backtracking. In addition, I use <b>C++ and C</b> in applications such as programming microcontrollers, or general programming. I also use <b>HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and Git</b> when creating the frontend and backend for websites such as this one. In addition, I use <b>MATLAB</b> for mathematical computations and simulations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="point-right">
                <b>Hardware</b>
                <p>In many of my clubs and classes, I have done <b>PCB Design</b> with a wide range of functions. I have wired boards with <b> Sensors, Power Management, Microcontrollers and more</b>. I have experience  <b>Designing, Wiring, Simulating and Testing Boards</b>. I design boards on programs such as <b> Altium, Eagle, and Fusion 360</b>. I have programmed microcontrollers with a <b>Pickit using C++</b> and aspire to work more with embedded systems in the future. I have also worked with <b> Verilog and HDLs</b> in my classes and would enjoy working on them in real world contexts. I also have experience working with CAD with <b>Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks</b> </p>

                <b>Non - Technical </b>
                <p>I believe the business aspect of my degree makes me a well-rounded engineer. It has improved my <b>Oral and Written Communication</b> skills and my ability to present and communicate my ideas to others. In addition, planning events for Space Apps and McMaster Engineering and Management Society has taught me a lot on <b> Marketing, Sponsorship Outreach, and Cost Analysis</b>. Furthermore, I have great <b>Interpersonal and Customer Service</b> skills from networking and working in retail.</p>
